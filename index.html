                CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational
                vision of St Kuriakose Elias Chavara, an educationalist and
                social reformer of the nineteenth century in South India. He
                founded the first Catholic indigenous congregation, Carmelites
                of Mary Immaculate (CMI), in 1831 which administers CHRIST
                (Deemed to be University).
